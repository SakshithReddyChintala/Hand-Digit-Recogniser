# Handwritten_digit_recognizer

### What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

### About the Python Deep Learning Project
we are going to implement a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset. We will be using a special type of deep neural network that is Convolutional Neural Networks. In the end, we are going to build a GUI in which you can draw the digit and recognize it straight away.

### Prerequisites
The interesting Python project requires you to have basic knowledge of Python programming, deep learning with Keras library and the Tkinter library for building GUI.

Install the necessary libraries for this project using this command:

pip install numpy, tensorflow, keras, pillow,

### The MNIST dataset
This is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
